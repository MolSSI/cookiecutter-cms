# Sample Package Data

This directory contains sample additional data you may want to include with your package.
This is a place where non-code related additional information (such as data files, molecular structures,  etc.) can 
go that you want to ship alongside your code.

## Including package data

Modify your package's `setup.py` file and the `setup()` command. Include the 
[`package_data`](http://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#basic-use) keyword and point it at the 
correct files.
